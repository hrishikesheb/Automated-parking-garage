# Automated-parking-garage

In this project we have use 2 IR Sensors each are placed in car slots, 1 IR Sensor near the gate and a servo motor near the gate to lift it when a car arrives in front of it (depends upon the availability of slots). The information
About the availability of slots is displaced on the LCD display. For example, one of the cases if slot 1 and 2 have cars parked and there is another car near the gate then the LCD displays "SLOT FULL" and the servo motor does not lift the gate.
